# Solution of Computer Exercise 4

## The basic experiment...

As we have seen in the lecture, an artificial neural network is built via propagate-optimize-predict 

## What about the hyperparameters?

### Learning rate

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.

### Number of iterations

The number of iterations is a hyperparameter that controls how many times the weights are updated.

### 

## Why scaling?
